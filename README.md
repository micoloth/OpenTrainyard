# Limitations

Bevy is still in development, and it lacks many features especially when it comes to UI. So the buttons are not as pretty as in the original. I might redesign them when Bevy matures.

Also there is no sound, and no Level Editor.

Contributions are always welcome!

I've also taken the liberty of redesigning the menu screen. The gameplay though, is pretty close to the original one..
